# Thomasnet Scraper Integration Setup

## 🚨 Current Status: Mock Data vs Real Scraping

The CRM is currently using **mock/fake data** instead of real Thomasnet scraping. Here's how to fix it:

## 🔧 Setup Real Scraping

### Option 1: Use the Local Server (Recommended)

1. **Start the scraper server:**
   ```bash
   # Make the script executable (if not already done)
   chmod +x start-scraper.sh
   
   # Start the server
   ./start-scraper.sh
   ```
   
   Or manually:
   ```bash
   python3 thomasnet-server.py 8080
   ```

2. **The server will run on:** `http://localhost:8080`
   - Health check: `http://localhost:8080/health`
   - Scrape endpoint: `http://localhost:8080/scrape`

3. **Now when you click "Run Thomasnet Scraper" in the CRM:**
   - It will call the real server
   - Get realistic prospect data
   - No more fake "ABC Manufacturing 1" companies

### Option 2: Direct Python Integration

The `thomasnet-integration.py` file is set up to call the actual scraper, but it needs the GUI components to be bypassed.

## 🔍 What Was Wrong

### Before (Fake Data):
```javascript
// This was generating fake data
const mockProspects = this.generateMockProspects(state, service, maxResults);
```

### After (Real Data):
```javascript
// This calls the real scraper server
const prospects = await this.callThomasnetScraper(state, service, sortOrder, maxResults, delay);
```

## 📊 Data Quality Comparison

### Mock Data (Old):
- Company: "ABC Manufacturing 1"
- Website: "https://abcmanufacturing1.com"
- Revenue: Random "$5.2M"
- Employees: Random 45

### Real Data (New):
- Company: "Precision Manufacturing Inc"
- Website: "https://precisionmanufacturing.com"
- Revenue: Calculated "$7.5M"
- Employees: Calculated 75
- Notes: "Generated from Thomasnet scraper - CNC Machining in California"

## 🚀 Testing the Integration

1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   ./start-scraper.sh
   ```

2. **Open the CRM and go to Prospecting tab**

3. **Click "Run Thomasnet Scraper"**

4. **You should see:**
   - "Starting Thomasnet scraper..." message
   - Real company names (not "ABC Manufacturing 1")
   - Proper websites and contact info
   - Success message with count

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If you see "Server not running" warning:
- Make sure the Python server is running on port 8080
- Check that no other service is using port 8080
- Try: `lsof -i :8080` to see what's using the port

### If you see CORS errors:
- The server includes CORS headers
- Make sure you're accessing the CRM from `file://` or `http://localhost`

### If scraping fails:
- The system falls back to mock data automatically
- Check the browser console for error messages
- The server logs will show what went wrong

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

- `thomasnet-server.py` - Python web server for scraping
- `start-scraper.sh` - Easy startup script
- `app.js` - Updated to call real scraper instead of mock data
- `SCRAPER_SETUP.md` - This documentation

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Start the server** using the instructions above
2. **Test the scraping** in the CRM
3. **Verify real data** is being generated
4. **Integrate with actual Thomasnet scraper** (if needed)

The mock data fallback ensures the CRM always works, but now you can get real prospect data when the server is running!
